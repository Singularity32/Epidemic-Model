This project is a Monte Carlo simulation of the physical process of spread of diseases on a two-dimensional lattice.  In literature on epidemiology, this is referred toas the SIRS model, and in our case, we have an additional dynamics associated with exchange of the states of nearest neighbors.  

The SIRS model is a stochastic lattice model, where the local dynamics is given by transition probabilities at a given site from one state to another. The possible states at any site are susceptible (S), infected (I) or recovered(R).  The rate for the transition S->I, is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors that are infected times at that instant time a constant lambda, while the other transitions I-->R and R-->S are given by fixed rates, delta and gamma.  The exchange dynamics is simultaenous process where the states of nearest neighbors are switched at a rate alpha. 

We are interested here in analyzing the steady state distribution of the system. Specifically, we consider the non-trivial steady state where there is a finite fraction of infected sites. We want to understand how the probabilites for a site being infected, recovered, or susceptible, and the joint nearest nirghbor probabilities for every combination of this state, depends on the rates of the model.  

The program that implements the simulation is written in C. The plots are based on the data that was obtained from it, for various sets of parameters (i.e. rates).
